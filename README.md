# Hybrid QA Automation Project: Selenium vs. AI 

This project demonstrates a comparative study between traditional **Code-based Automation** and modern **AI-Powered Automation**.

## Technologies Used
* **Python & Selenium WebDriver:** For custom script-based testing.
* **Testim.io:** For AI-driven self-healing automation.

## Project Structure
1.  `project_test.py` - The Python script using Selenium WebDriver and Explicit Waits to handle dynamic elements.
2.  **Screenshots folder** - Evidence of execution and AI analysis.

## Key Highlights
* **Selenium Approach:** Implemented `WebDriverWait` to handle cart update delays efficiently.
* **AI Approach:** Used Testim.io to demonstrate **Self-Healing**. As seen in the screenshots, the AI uses smart locators (analyzing DOM attributes) to prevent flaky tests.
